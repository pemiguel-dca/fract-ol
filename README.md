The purpose of this project is to create fractals using the Minilibx library, and to explore 2D programming.

In this project you will be able to understand the basic use of Minilibx and it's respective functions.

Keep in mind that the Minilibx library is not one of the best for graphic design, it's just a requirement for this project by the 42School.

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pemiguel-dca/fract-ol.git
```
When you have cloned the repo, you just need to run ```make``` inside of the 'src' directory.

## Fractals available

You can use the following parameters:

```bash
./fractol Mandelbrot
./fractol Julia [real] [imaginary]
./fractol Surprise
```

If you don't have any idea of how the Julia set works you can just visit this page '[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)' and find both real and imaginary to create amazing pictures.

## Features available

You can use '+' or '-' to change color, the '-' makes go to the previous color.

You also can zoom in and zoom out using the mouse wheel, although the zoom is always in the same point.

The arrows also change the position of the fractal in the window.
